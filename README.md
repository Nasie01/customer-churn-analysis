# Customer Churn Analysis

## Executive Summary

**Objective:**
The purpose of this analysis was to identify the key drivers of customer churn and assess their financial impact.

**Key findings:**
- The highest churn rate (28.1%) occurs within the first six months of product usage, while later tenure periods remain relatively stable at around 7–8%;
- Inactivity is a strong churn signal: churn increases steadily after 26 days without login (~20%) and exceeds 40% after 56 days; 
- Customers with low CSAT scores churn nearly three times more often than those with neutral or positive experiences;
- 
**Non-significant factors:**
Age, usage growth rate, contract type, price increase, response time, and email open rate do not have a significant impact on churn, with differences across segments remaining within 1%.

**Financial impact:**
Customer churn results in revenue losses exceeding 860,000, with more than  670,000 coming from long-tenure customers.

**Recommendations:**
- Focus retention efforts on early risk signals, particularly low CSAT and prolonged inactivity;
- Prioritize retention of long-tenure users, as this segment represents the most stable and valuable revenue.

## Dataset
